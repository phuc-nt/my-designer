# Community

Community is the public design-sharing surface at `/community`. Free CC-BY-4.0 designs can be discovered by category, tags, format, period, creator and collection, downloaded as ready files, and remixed into independent private projects. Home `Cmd+K`/`Ctrl+K` searches owned projects; the same shortcut on Community searches live community metadata. URL filters support direct links and browser history.

## Publication and privacy

The [shared contracts](../src/shared/community.ts) and [operation inventory](../src/shared/community-endpoints.ts) own request fields and client discovery. Preflight reads an owned saved revision, projects the public design and returns a digest. The author reviews the projection and source disclosures, then explicitly confirms public publication and the license. The server recomputes the digest and checks project/listing revisions. Exact retries reuse the same operation ID and payload; changed payloads conflict.

[Projection](../src/shared/community-projection.ts) removes notes, hidden descendants, unrelated opaque data and unused media, retains required character dependencies, and flattens painting to its visible composite. External media must be imported before publication. Do not equate canonical document validation with public-source approval. Existing `/api/projects/:id/publish`, preview and share aliases keep their separate lifecycle and do not automatically list work in Community.

[Publication jobs](../server/community-publication.ts) pin immutable versions and copy assets before rendering a selected cover/download formats and the portable package. Only a guarded activation makes a version live. Later private edits do not change it. Owner unlisting, moderator suppression and source deletion remain separate state. Restore cannot override owner unlisting or deletion. An active source-copy lease makes source deletion return `409 publication_busy`; otherwise deletion claims against new work, revokes public serving and schedules cleanup. Completed private remixes survive.

Preflight checks PNG sequence and spritesheet sampling against the shared [frame export budget](../src/shared/frame-export-budget.ts) before accepting publication. Each archive allows 1–300 frames and 64 megapixels across all frames at the selected page's native dimensions. An oversized request returns `413 render_budget_exceeded` with the dimensions, selected duration and supported FPS; explicit API options are never silently reduced. At 1280 × 800 over 9.25 seconds, 30 fps exceeds the budget while 7 fps fits 65 frames. Reduce FPS, shorten the selected interval, or change the page dimensions before requesting a fresh preflight.

Spritesheet grids additionally allow at most 16,384 pixels per side; wide or tall pages may therefore need a lower FPS than a PNG sequence of the same duration. The shared check includes the renderer's square-grid arrangement, so an archive exceeding that side limit is rejected during preflight too.

In the Publish dialog, **All** selects or clears the supported optional download formats; the portable Studio package is always included. **Frame archive FPS** shows the sampling rate used for PNG sequences and spritesheets, initially the lower of 30 fps and the budget-supported rate. This preserves the complete timeline and native page dimensions; other format requests retain 30 fps. An entered rate is checked before publication rather than silently changed. If even 1 fps cannot fit, adjust the design duration or dimensions, or clear the frame archive formats.

Publication remains in progress after the server accepts its durable receipt. The dialog shows job progress while the worker builds files and displays **Congratulations** only after the job reports success. A failed job keeps its actionable error visible so the author can correct the options and retry.

## Draft listing details with AI

The Publish dialog offers **Generate with AI** for Title, Description and Tags, including when a public profile already exists. It uses the first configured text provider and its saved model by default, with another connection selectable. Optional writing instructions, entered listing fields and a bounded summary of the saved design's visible text and structure are sent to the provider. Notes, hidden content, account identity and media URLs are excluded. This is text-based drafting; AI does not inspect the cover image. Provider usage may incur charges.

The [metadata generation service](../server/community-metadata-generation.ts) verifies project ownership and the observed saved revision before and after generation. It returns a validated suggestion without saving or publishing. Review and apply it to the editable fields; applying clears any previous preflight and consent. Manual edits or a changed source revision prevent stale suggestions from overwriting the form. Missing providers, provider errors and revision conflicts have recovery controls; manual entry remains available.

Use `POST /api/community/metadata/generate`, MCP `community_generate_metadata`, WebMCP `studio_community_generate_metadata`, or `dsa community generate-metadata --file request.json`. The shared schema requires `projectId` and `expectedProjectRevision`, with optional `provider`, `title`, `description`, `tags` and `prompt`. Responses contain `suggestion`, `provider` and `projectRevision`. Show the suggestion to the person, then run a separate preflight using their reviewed fields. Generation is never publication consent.

## Files, jobs and storage

[Portable packages](../src/shared/community-package.ts) wrap the canonical document with checked asset bytes, hashes, license and attribution. Limits are 20 MiB compressed, 64 MiB expanded and 1,000 entries. The builder uses STORE; imports also support bounded streaming DEFLATE. Package-local asset URLs resolve exclusively through the manifest, without fetching source URLs. GLB media must contain its dependencies. Import validates paths, sizes, checksums and references before creating an independent project; archive attribution remains unverified.

[Workers](../server/community-worker.ts) use durable receipts, conditional leases and storage intents so retries can resume or clean up deterministically. [Storage admission](../server/community-assets.ts) counts private assets, Community files and outstanding reservations against one owner budget; private upload admission uses the same totals. Live download routes verify visibility before serving bytes and never start an anonymous renderer. Current/previous successful versions are retained; purged report content is unavailable rather than retained secretly.

## Discovery, recognition and moderation

[Search queries](../server/community-queries.ts) use a live-only FTS5 projection and bounded cursor pagination. Vietnamese normalization preserves display text while supporting accent-insensitive search. Changed ranking generations require a cursor reset. Most used/downloaded reflect unique eligible authenticated recipients; self-actions and repeats do not inflate them. Guest served-download aggregates are separate. Creator milestones count distinct recipients across listings, and private remix identity is not published.

Profiles opt in; bookmarks and impact management remain owner-scoped. Operators review version-pinned reports, record hide/restore/dismiss reasons, and curate reviewed listing versions. [Deployment](deployment.md#community-rollout) owns feature and admin configuration. ID grants and verified GitHub email pregrants are separate from observability administration; ordinary password registration does not prove an email grant. Moderation excludes OAuth credentials.

The public-profile form offers **Generate with AI** for display name, handle and bio. It defaults to the first configured text connection, matching the brief editor, and lets the author select another connection. Optional writing instructions and the entered profile fields are sent to that provider; account identity and private projects are not added as context. Generation uses the saved model and may incur provider usage. Without a configured text provider, manual editing remains available with a Settings link.

The [generation service](../server/community-profile-generation.ts) returns a validated suggestion without storing or publishing it. Review and apply the suggestion, then explicitly save the public profile. A suggestion cannot silently replace manual edits made while it was generated. Handles must be valid, non-reserved and available when suggested; the existing uniqueness and revision checks remain authoritative when saving. Provider failures or invalid/taken suggestions return actionable errors rather than fabricated fallback content.

## People and agents

The public [Community guide](../src/app/community-documentation.tsx) is generated at `/docs/community`. REST, MCP `community_*`, WebMCP `studio_community_*`, and CLI `dsa community` share the operation inventory and validators. Use `community_capabilities`, `studio_community_capabilities`, `dsa community schema`, or `/api/schema` before composing writes. MCP byte results and MCP/WebMCP base64 imports cap at 12 MiB; larger files use CLI or the browser file picker. Download tools return actual bytes, while preview tools identify sandboxed preview resources.

Profile drafting is `POST /api/community/me/profile/generate`, `community_generate_profile`, `studio_community_generate_profile`, or `dsa community generate-profile --file request.json`. The shared request schema accepts an optional provider, draft profile fields and writing instructions. A response contains `suggestion` and the selected `provider`. This incurs generation only; use the separate revision-checked `set-profile` operation after the person reviews the result.

Release evidence and remaining verification work belong in the [implementation plan](../plans/2026-09-12-community-design-sharing/plan.md), not this behavior guide.
